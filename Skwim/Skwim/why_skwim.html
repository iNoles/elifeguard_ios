    <li>SKWIM is the first interactive team sport for both the occasional and avid swimmer! "Lets go to the pool and have a "pick-up game"! This proclamation can now be made about SKWIM. U.S. and global aquatic enthusiasts deserve an interactive and social team sport that reaches a broader populous; for all ages and abilities. Roughly 150 million Americans  (50% of the population) can swim.  Approx. 52 million (18%) swim at least once a year (NSGA 2007), second only to walking. But less than 1% actually swim regularly or seasonally. Why? Because there hasn't been a fun, engaging, and easy to play water sport until now. SKWIM can be played, recreational and occasionally, or competitively and often. SKWIM works well as a P.E. activity, a weekend social event, or a club athletic program. Players can choose their own tempo and intensity. At a slower tempo SKWIM is quite easy to play. At a higher tempo the sport can be as physically demanding as any. SKWIM brings more people to the water and keeps them coming back. This is the key to building water-safe, water-smart, water-strong community
    </li>
    <li>SKWIM enhances water safety and can help save lives! According to the CDC (Center for Disease Control 2007) 50 people a day in the U.S. are hospitalized due to a near drowning or drowning incident. Of these 50, 10 do not survive the incident, and others are left disabled physically, psychologically, or emotionally. An "interactive, non-contact" sport that invites the majority of the population to participate, has long been awaited in aquatics. Now much more of the community can play in the water and gain confidence.
        <ul>
            <li>People of all ages and abilities can play SKWIM. The secret lies in the use of Positive Drive Fins in the game. These fins help improve swimming skills while also increasing confidence in the water.
            </li>
            <li>The mechanics of SKWIM most closely emulate lifesaving technique, and help prepare youth for lifeguard training. SKWIM is easy to learn and yet can build advanced water skills with regular play.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SKWIM appeals to the social being! Both demographics and history support the fact that people prefer to "interact" in a sporting event. Of the top U.S. youth sports, the majority of participants are involved in interactive team sports, vs. individualized sporting events.
        <ul>
            <li>The top 3 youth sports are soccer, baseball, and basketball. These 3 sports also share similar traits: "non-contact", "co-gender", and an "easy" entry level. SKWIM is the only watersport that shares these same common traits.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SKWIM is more about team skills!. It requires a composite of many skills, and not just swimming speed, or strength. SKWIM is more about technique and imagination. SKWIM is more like soccer and basketball, in how the sport moves and is tempered regarding contact and aggression.
    </li>
    <li>
        SKWIM is about playing time! Again, SKWIM compares best to soccer or basketball. SKWIM requires less overall water time for practice, using more for actual "game-time".
    </li>

Well, if you have come this far into our website, you might be seeking the same thing thousands of people are; building water-safety, and water-fitness in a more fun and exciting way. SKWIM might be the answer for you.<br><br>
Do any of these scenarios apply to you?
<ol>
    <li>"I have grown up around the water and love swimming but I am not fast; is there a water-sport I can play once a week or a few times a month, and still be part of a competitive team?"</li>
    <li>"I want to learn to swim, but at this point of my life, I don't know how. Is there a way to learn that is fun and teaches me more quickly and more engagingly?"</li>
    <li>"I am over 50 and finding it harder staying in shape without injury. I miss being active and competitive. I miss playing on a team and the comradely it brings. Is there a sport my body can hold up to?"</li>
    <li>I'm very busy with travel and cannot keep up on my training right now. Is there a sport I can jump in on and play a pick-up game that is safe? I can't afford a turned ankle or torn cartilage. I can't miss work!</li>
    <li>I'm a stay at home mom. You would think I would have some time for the gym. I like team sports. Is there a team I can join without it taking over my life?</li>
    <li>I'm a busy parent of a couple of kids and we need to spend more time together, but I also need some exercise. Is there a sport that I can play with my kids instead of sitting there watching??</li>
</ol>
Recent studies, sponsored by USA Swimming, show that only about 50% of children ages 6-15 can swim. Other studies indicate that only 30% of the U.S. population can swim 100 yards (300 feet).<br><br>
Swimming involves a series of complex motor skills which, when practiced and repeated, become more efficient and effective, thus increasing both performance and confidence. For best success, people of all ages need to be in the water regularly, in a structured program, in order to improve beyond "beginning swimming". As with most other activities and sports, improvement comes with consistent practice while under a teacher's positive instruction. Among professionals, a common recommended frequency is a minimum of 2 or more times a week - more - in order to see good results in fitness, and proficiency.
